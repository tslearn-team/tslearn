    r"""Compute Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) similarity measure between
    (possibly multidimensional) time series using a distance metric defined by
    the user and return both the path and the similarity.

    Similarity is computed as the cumulative cost along the aligned time
    series.

    It is not required that both time series share the same size, but they must
    be the same dimension. DTW was originally presented in [1]_.

    Valid values for metric are the same as for scikit-learn
    `pairwise_distances`_ function i.e. a string (e.g. "euclidean",
    "sqeuclidean", "hamming") or a function that is used to compute the
    pairwise distances. See `scikit`_ and `scipy`_ documentations for more
    information about the available metrics.

    Parameters
    ----------
    s1 : array, shape = (sz1, d) if metric!="precomputed", (sz1, sz2) otherwise
        A time series or an array of pairwise distances between samples.

    s2 : array, shape = (sz2, d), optional (default: None)
        A second time series, only allowed if metric != "precomputed".

    metric : string or callable (default: "euclidean")
        Function used to compute the pairwise distances between each points of
        `s1` and `s2`.

        If metric is "precomputed", `s1` is assumed to be a distance matrix.

        If metric is an other string, it must be one of the options compatible
        with sklearn.metrics.pairwise_distances.

        Alternatively, if metric is a callable function, it is called on pairs
        of rows of `s1` and `s2`. The callable should take two 1 dimensional
        arrays as input and return a value indicating the distance between
        them.

    global_constraint : {"itakura", "sakoe_chiba"} or None (default: None)
        Global constraint to restrict admissible paths for DTW.

    sakoe_chiba_radius : int or None (default: None)
        Radius to be used for Sakoe-Chiba band global constraint.
        If None and `global_constraint` is set to "sakoe_chiba", a radius of
        1 is used.
        If both `sakoe_chiba_radius` and `itakura_max_slope` are set,
        `global_constraint` is used to infer which constraint to use among the
        two. In this case, if `global_constraint` corresponds to no global
        constraint, a `RuntimeWarning` is raised and no global constraint is
        used.

    itakura_max_slope : float or None (default: None)
        Maximum slope for the Itakura parallelogram constraint.
        If None and `global_constraint` is set to "itakura", a maximum slope
        of 2. is used.
        If both `sakoe_chiba_radius` and `itakura_max_slope` are set,
        `global_constraint` is used to infer which constraint to use among the
        two. In this case, if `global_constraint` corresponds to no global
        constraint, a `RuntimeWarning` is raised and no global constraint is
        used.

    **kwds
        Additional arguments to pass to sklearn pairwise_distances to compute
        the pairwise distances.

    Returns
    -------
    list of integer pairs
        Matching path represented as a list of index pairs. In each pair, the
        first index corresponds to s1 and the second one corresponds to s2.

    float
        Similarity score (sum of metric along the wrapped time series).

    Examples
    --------
    Lets create 2 numpy arrays to wrap:

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> rng = np.random.RandomState(0)
    >>> s1, s2 = rng.rand(5, 2), rng.rand(6, 2)

    The wrapping can be done by passing a string indicating the metric to pass
    to scikit-learn pairwise_distances:

    >>> dtw_path_from_metric(s1, s2,
    ...                      metric="sqeuclidean")  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    ([(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)], 1.117...)

    Or by defining a custom distance function:

    >>> sqeuclidean = lambda x, y: np.sum((x-y)**2)
    >>> dtw_path_from_metric(s1, s2, metric=sqeuclidean)  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    ([(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)], 1.117...)

    Or by using a precomputed distance matrix as input:

    >>> from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import pairwise_distances
    >>> dist_matrix = pairwise_distances(s1, s2, metric="sqeuclidean")
    >>> dtw_path_from_metric(dist_matrix,
    ...                      metric="precomputed")  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    ([(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)], 1.117...)

    Notes
    --------
    By using a squared euclidean distance metric as shown above, the output
    path is the same as the one obtained by using dtw_path but the similarity
    score is the sum of squared distances instead of the euclidean distance.

def dtw_limited_warping_length(s1, s2, max_length):
    r"""Compute Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) similarity measure between
    (possibly multidimensional) time series under an upper bound constraint on
    the resulting path length and return the similarity cost.

    DTW is computed as the Euclidean distance between aligned time series,
    i.e., if :math:`\pi` is the optimal alignment path:

    .. math::

        DTW(X, Y) = \sqrt{\sum_{(i, j) \in \pi} \|X_{i} - Y_{j}\|^2}

    Note that this formula is still valid for the multivariate case.

    It is not required that both time series share the same size, but they must
    be the same dimension. DTW was originally presented in [1]_.
    This constrained-length variant was introduced in [2]_.
    Both bariants are
    discussed in more details in our :ref:`dedicated user-guide page <dtw>`

    Parameters
    ----------
    s1
        A time series.

    s2
        Another time series.

    max_length : int
        Maximum allowed warping path length.
        If greater than len(s1) + len(s2), then it is equivalent to
        unconstrained DTW.
        If lower than max(len(s1), len(s2)), no path can be found and a
        ValueError is raised.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        Similarity score

    Examples
    --------
    >>> dtw_limited_warping_length([1, 2, 3], [1., 2., 2., 3.], 5)
    0.0
    >>> dtw_limited_warping_length([1, 2, 3], [1., 2., 2., 3., 4.], 5)

    between (possibly multidimensional) time series and return the

    LCSS is computed by matching indexes that are met up until the eps
    threshold, so it leaves some points unmatched and focuses on the
    similar parts of two sequences. The matching can occur even if the
    time indexes are different, regulated through the delta parameter
    that defines how far it can go. To retrieve a meaningful similarity
    value from the length of the longest common subsequence, the
    percentage of that value regarding the length of the shortest time
    series is returned.

    According to this definition, the values returned by LCSS range from
    0 to 1, the highest value taken when two time series fully match,
    and vice-versa. It is not required that both time series share the
    same size, but they must be the same dimension. LCSS was originally

    chiba radius parameter that defines how far it can go.

    To retrieve a meaningful similarity value from the length of the
    longest common subsequence, the percentage of that value regarding
    the length of the shortest time series is returned.

    According to this definition, the values returned by LCSS range from
    0 to 1, the highest value taken when two time series fully match,
    and vice-versa. It is not required that both time series share the
    same size, but they must be the same dimension. LCSS was originally
    presented in [1]_ and is discussed in more details in our
    :ref:`dedicated user-guide page <lcss>`.

    Note
    ----
    Contrary to Dynamic Time Warping and variants, an LCSS path does not need to be contiguous.

    Parameters
    ----------
    s1
        A time series.

    s2
        Another time series.

    eps : float (default: 1.)
        Maximum matching distance threshold.

    global_constraint : {"itakura", "sakoe_chiba"} or None (default: None)
       Global constraint to restrict admissible paths for LCSS.

    sakoe_chiba_radius : int or None (default: None)
       Radius to be used for Sakoe-Chiba band global constraint.
       If None and `global_constraint` is set to "sakoe_chiba", a radius of
       1 is used.
       If both `sakoe_chiba_radius` and `itakura_max_slope` are set,
       `global_constraint` is used to infer which constraint to use among the
       two. In this case, if `global_constraint` corresponds to no global
       constraint, a `RuntimeWarning` is raised and no global constraint is
       used.

    itakura_max_slope : float or None (default: None)
       Maximum slope for the Itakura parallelogram constraint.
       If None and `global_constraint` is set to "itakura", a maximum slope
       of 2. is used.
       If both `sakoe_chiba_radius` and `itakura_max_slope` are set,
       `global_constraint` is used to infer which constraint to use among the
       two. In this case, if `global_constraint` corresponds to no global
       constraint, a `RuntimeWarning` is raised and no global constraint is
       used.

    Returns
    -------
    list of integer pairs
        Matching path represented as a list of index pairs. In each pair, the
        first index corresponds to s1 and the second one corresponds to s2

    float
        Similarity score

    Examples
    --------
    >>> path, sim = lcss_path([1., 2., 3.], [1., 2., 2., 3.])
    >>> path
    [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3)]
    >>> sim
    1.0
    >>> lcss_path([1., 2., 3.], [1., 2., 2., 4.])[1]
    1.0

    r"""Compute the Longest Common Subsequence (LCSS) similarity measure between
    (possibly multidimensional) time series using a distance metric defined by
    the user and return both the path and the similarity.

    Having the length of the longest commom subsequence between two time-series,
    the similarity is computed as the percentage of that value regarding the
    length of the shortest time series.

    It is not required that both time series share the same size, but they must
    be the same dimension. LCSS was originally presented in [1]_.

    Valid values for metric are the same as for scikit-learn
    `pairwise_distances`_ function i.e. a string (e.g. "euclidean",
    "sqeuclidean", "hamming") or a function that is used to compute the
    pairwise distances. See `scikit`_ and `scipy`_ documentations for more
    information about the available metrics.

    Parameters
    ----------
    s1 : array, shape = (sz1, d) if metric!="precomputed", (sz1, sz2) otherwise
        A time series or an array of pairwise distances between samples.

    s2 : array, shape = (sz2, d), optional (default: None)
        A second time series, only allowed if metric != "precomputed".

    eps : float (default: 1.)
        Maximum matching distance threshold.
        
    metric : string or callable (default: "euclidean")
        Function used to compute the pairwise distances between each points of
        `s1` and `s2`.

        If metric is "precomputed", `s1` is assumed to be a distance matrix.

        If metric is an other string, it must be one of the options compatible
        with sklearn.metrics.pairwise_distances.

        Alternatively, if metric is a callable function, it is called on pairs
        of rows of `s1` and `s2`. The callable should take two 1 dimensional
        arrays as input and return a value indicating the distance between
        them.
        
    global_constraint : {"itakura", "sakoe_chiba"} or None (default: None)
        Global constraint to restrict admissible paths for LCSS.
        
    sakoe_chiba_radius : int or None (default: None)
        Radius to be used for Sakoe-Chiba band global constraint.
        If None and `global_constraint` is set to "sakoe_chiba", a radius of
        1 is used.
        If both `sakoe_chiba_radius` and `itakura_max_slope` are set,
        `global_constraint` is used to infer which constraint to use among the
        two. In this case, if `global_constraint` corresponds to no global
        constraint, a `RuntimeWarning` is raised and no global constraint is
        used.
        
    itakura_max_slope : float or None (default: None)
        Maximum slope for the Itakura parallelogram constraint.
        If None and `global_constraint` is set to "itakura", a maximum slope
        of 2. is used.
        If both `sakoe_chiba_radius` and `itakura_max_slope` are set,
        `global_constraint` is used to infer which constraint to use among the
        two. In this case, if `global_constraint` corresponds to no global
        constraint, a `RuntimeWarning` is raised and no global constraint is
        used.
        
    **kwds
        Additional arguments to pass to sklearn pairwise_distances to compute
        the pairwise distances.

    Returns
    -------
    list of integer pairs
        Matching path represented as a list of index pairs. In each pair, the
        first index corresponds to s1 and the second one corresponds to s2.

    float
        Similarity score.

    Examples
    --------
    Lets create 2 numpy arrays to wrap:

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> rng = np.random.RandomState(0)
    >>> s1, s2 = rng.rand(5, 2), rng.rand(6, 2)

    The wrapping can be done by passing a string indicating the metric to pass
    to scikit-learn pairwise_distances:

    >>> lcss_path_from_metric(s1, s2,
    ...                      metric="sqeuclidean")  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    ([(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)], 1.0)

    Or by defining a custom distance function:

    >>> sqeuclidean = lambda x, y: np.sum((x-y)**2)
    >>> lcss_path_from_metric(s1, s2, metric=sqeuclidean)  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    ([(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)], 1.0)

    Or by using a precomputed distance matrix as input:

    >>> from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import pairwise_distances
    >>> dist_matrix = pairwise_distances(s1, s2, metric="sqeuclidean")
    >>> lcss_path_from_metric(dist_matrix,
    ...                      metric="precomputed")  # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    ([(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)], 1.0)

    Notes
    --------
    By using a squared euclidean distance metric as shown above, the output
    path and similarity is the same as the one obtained by using lcss_path 
    (which uses the euclidean distance) simply because with the sum of squared
    distances the matching threshold is still not reached.
    Also, contrary to Dynamic Time Warping and variants, an LCSS path does not need to be contiguous.
