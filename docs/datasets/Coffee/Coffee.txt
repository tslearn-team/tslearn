"FoodFood spectrographs are used in chemometrics to classify food types, a task that has obvious applications in food safety and quality assurance. The coffee data set is a two class problem to distinguish between Robusta and Aribica coffee beans. Further information can be found in the original paper Briandet et al. Discrimination of Arabica and Robusta in Instant Coffee by Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy and Chemometrics J. Agricultural and Food Chemistry, 44 (1), 1996. The data was first used in the time series classification literature in Bagnall et al. Transformation Based Ensembles for Time Series Classification, SDM 2012.
