This dataset was formatted by R. Olszewski as part of his thesis
“Generalized feature extraction for structural	pattern recognition
in time-series data,” at Carnegie Mellon University, 2001. Each
series traces the electrical activity recorded during one
heartbeat. The two classes are a normal heartbeat and a Myocardial
Infarction.
