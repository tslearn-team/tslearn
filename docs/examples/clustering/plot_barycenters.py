Barycenters
===========

This example shows three methods to compute barycenters of time series.
For an overview over the available methods see the :mod:`tslearn.barycenters`
module.

*tslearn* provides three methods for calculating barycenters for a given set of
time series:

* *Euclidean barycenter* is simply the arithmetic mean for
  each individual point in time, minimizing the summed euclidean distance
  for each of them. As can be seen below, it is very different from the
  DTW-based methods and may often be inappropriate. However, it is the
  fastest of the methods shown.
* *DTW Barycenter Averaging (DBA)* is an iteratively refined barycenter,
  starting out with a (potentially) bad candidate and improving it
  until convergence criteria are met. The optimization can be accomplished
  with (a) expectation-maximization [1] and (b) stochastic subgradient
  descent [2]. Empirically, the latter "is [often] more stable and finds better
  solutions in shorter time" [2].
* *Soft-DTW barycenter* uses a differentiable loss function to iteratively
  find a barycenter [3]. The method itself and the parameter
  :math:`\\gamma=1.0` is described in more detail in the section on
  :ref:`DTW<dtw>`. There is also a dedicated
  :ref:`example<sphx_glr_auto_examples_clustering_plot_barycenter_interpolate.py>`
  available.
